					<p>Contrary to popular belief, <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at <em>Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia</em>, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de <u>Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</u>" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. <strike>This book is a treatise</strike> on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
